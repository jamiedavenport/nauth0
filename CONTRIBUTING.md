# How to Contribute

ðŸ‘‹ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## New to Open Source?

Take a look at [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Look for issues with the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/jamiedavenport/nauth0/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) tag.

## Development Setup

First you need to fork and clone the repo. Then:

```bash
# Install Deps
yarn

# Run
yarn dev

# Test
yarn test --watch
```
