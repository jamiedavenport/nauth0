# How to Contribute

ðŸ‘‹ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## New to Open Source?

Take a look at [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Look for issues with the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/jamiedavenport/nauth0/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) tag.

We follow the [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) spec so please add yourself by running the following commands:

### All Contributors

```bash
yarn contributors:add <username> <contribution>
yarn contributors:generate
```

- `username` is your GitHub username
- `contribtuion` is the type of contribution you've made. See [this](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for a list of options.

Don't forget to check and commit the changes.

## Development Setup

First you need to fork and clone the repo. Then:

```bash
# Install Deps
yarn

# Run
yarn dev

# Test
yarn test --watch
```

If you're using linux, you will need to install some [dependencies](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#Linux) so that [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) will work for tests.

We run a local OIDC provider that allows any username/password combination to login for development purposes.
